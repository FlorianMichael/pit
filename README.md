**pit** is a fully local and independent password manager and information storage tool.
All data is stored exclusively encrypted on your own computer – there is no cloud, no external servers, and no third-party dependencies.

The archive can theoretically also be updated manually by adding or removing files directly (as long as encryption is respected).
pit is ideal for anyone who wants maximum control and independence when managing sensitive information.
